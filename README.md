###Graph Data Structure Implementation

There are two standard ways of represent a graph G =(V,E):
			Adjacency Matrix
			Adjacency List

Either way applies to both directed and undirected graphs.

In this program all the basic functionalities have been implemented using adjacency list representation.

The adjacency list representation of a graph G =(V,E) consists of an array Adj of |V| lists,one for each vertex in V.For each u element of V , the adjacency list adj[u] contains all the vertices v such that there is an edge (u,v) element of E. That is, Adj[u] consists of all the vertices adajacent to u in G.


Basic Operation on Graph Data Structure

1.Create Graph
2.Add vertex
3.Add edge
4.Remove vertex
5.Remove edge
6.Breadth First Search
7.Depth first search
